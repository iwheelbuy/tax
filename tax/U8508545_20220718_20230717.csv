Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,"For shares traded on US markets, Interactive Brokers Ireland Limited (IBIE) acts as agent in executing the fractional portion of your order. In certain circumstances, IBIE routes that portion to an affiliate, which may execute it either as principal or riskless principal. If an IB affiliate executes as i) principal, the order will be executed at the price displayed for the opposite side of the NBBO from your order (the offer if you are buying and the bid if you are selling) at the time of execution, ii) riskless principal, the affiliate will execute that portion of your order at the price it receives for the execution of the whole share. The way in which the fractional portion of the order is executed is indicated by the codes associated with the trade. For shares traded on European Markets, IBIE will generally act as counterparty for any fractional portion of your order for shares, which it will execute as principal, for a total consideration which is equal to (or better than), the total consideration for the execution of a full share available at the European trading venues and SIs to which IBIE has access. In certain circumstances, IBIE may route a full share order to the available European trading venues acting in an Agency capacity and the fractional portion of the order will be allocated to your account at the price traded in the trading venue and the remaining fractional portion will be allocated to an affiliate.
