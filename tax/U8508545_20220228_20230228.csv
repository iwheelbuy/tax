Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,"Most stock exchange transactions settle on the trade date plus two business days. Options, futures and US open-end mutual fund transactions settle on trade date plus one business day. (Some exchanges and other transaction types may have longer or shorter settlement periods.) Ending settled cash reflects the cash that has actually settled.  "
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,Initial and maintenance margin requirements are available within the Account Window of the Trader Workstation.
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,Quantities preceded by a "-" sign indicate sell transactions. Other transactions are purchases. 
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,"For shares traded on US markets, Interactive Brokers Ireland Limited (IBIE) acts as agent in executing the fractional portion of your order. In certain circumstances, IBIE routes that portion to an affiliate, which may execute it either as principal or riskless principal. If an IB affiliate executes as i) principal, the order will be executed at the price displayed for the opposite side of the NBBO from your order (the offer if you are buying and the bid if you are selling) at the time of execution, ii) riskless principal, the affiliate will execute that portion of your order at the price it receives for the execution of the whole share. The way in which the fractional portion of the order is executed is indicated by the codes associated with the trade. For shares traded on European Markets, IBIE will generally act as counterparty for any fractional portion of your order for shares, which it will execute as principal, for a total consideration which is equal to (or better than), the total consideration for the execution of a full share available at the European trading venues and SIs to which IBIE has access. In certain circumstances, IBIE may route a full share order to the available European trading venues acting in an Agency capacity and the fractional portion of the order will be allocated to your account at the price traded in the trading venue and the remaining fractional portion will be allocated to an affiliate. "
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,"In case of partial executions, commissions are charged on the total quantity executed on the original order. The commission is displayed on the first partial execution only."
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,Each closed lot indicated above with a reference to note (6) was chosen by the end of the trading day to be sold versus the specific opening purchase identified in that row.
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,Trade execution times are displayed in Eastern Time.
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,Applicable commodity Regulatory Fees for your transactions are available on the IB website at www.interactivebrokers.com/en/accounts/fees/exchangeAndRegulatoryFees.php.
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,"Borrow Fee Rate represents the cost to borrow stock expressed in percent per annum. It is applied to the collateral value on the stock borrow contract and is separate from any interest earned on credit cash balances. Similarly, Loan Fee Rate represents the benefit to lend stock. A positive rate indicates a cost to the borrower/benefit to the lender and a negative rate indicates a benefit to the borrower/cost to the lender. In general, the fee rates for hard-to-borrow stocks are higher than for normal availability stocks."
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,Interest Rate on Customer Collateral represents the interest paid on the collateral posted to the customer's account and received from lending stock.  A positive rate indicates a benefit to the lender.
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,"The closing prices on this Activity Statement are indicative and may come from third-party sources. Interactive Brokers does not warrant the accuracy of the prices provided by third-party sources. Due to time zone differences, certain non-US mutual funds may deliver closing prices after the Activity Statement has been produced and the closing prices for such funds will reflect the previous day's price."
